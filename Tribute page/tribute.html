                    <p class = "para-1">Abdul Qadeer Khan, also known as A.Q. Khan, (born April 1, 1936, Bhopal, India),
                        Pakistani engineer, a key figure in Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program who was 
                        also involved for decades in a black market of nuclear technology and know-how 
                        whereby uranium-enrichment centrifuges, nuclear warhead designs, missiles, and 
                        expertise were sold or traded to Iran, North Korea, Libya, and possibly other 
                        countries.</p>
                    <p class = "para-1"> In 1947, during Khan’s childhood, India achieved independence from Britain, and 
                        Muslim areas in the east and west were partitioned to form the state of Pakistan.
                         Khan immigrated to West Pakistan in 1952, and in 1960 he graduated from the 
                         University of Karachi with a degree in metallurgy. Over the next decade he 
                         pursued graduate studies abroad, first in West Berlin and then in Delft, 
                         Netherlands, where in 1967 he received a master’s degree in metallurgy. 
                         In 1972 he earned a doctorate in metallurgical engineering from the Catholic 
                         University of Leuven in Belgium. Meanwhile, in 1964 he married Hendrina Reterink
                         , a British national who had been born to Dutch expatriate parents in South 
                         Africa and raised in what was then Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) before moving 
                         to the Netherlands.</p>
